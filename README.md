# web-dev-exercise-todolist
A concept of a todo list app for registering common tasks, with a couple of lists for different types of tasks. This webapp was bult using NodeJS, ExpressJS, Mongoose and MongoDB. 

The project is based on a capstone project from Udemy's "The Complete 2023 Web Developer Bootcamp", created by the App Brewery team.

## Instalation

### Dependencies

Make sure you have NodeJS installed. Instructions on how to install on [Node's downloads page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager).

You'll also need to [install MongoDB Community Edition](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/) for storing the tasks generated by the website.

### Configuration

First, clone this project onto your local machine:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/GSAprod/udemy-web-dev-todolist.git
```

Start the `mongod` process and start a `mongosh` in order to configure our database. 

```
sudo systemctl start mongod
mongosh
```

While in session, create a new user in order for the website to access and write tasks and lists onto the database:

```
use todolistDB
db.createUser(
    {
        user: "myUser",
        pwd: passwordPrompt(),
        roles: [ { role: "readWrite", db: "todolistDB" } ]
    }
)
<enter the new password for the user>
exit
```

Create a duplicate of the `example.env` file, rename it to `.env` and replace the `<fields>` with all necessary values

**NOTE:** If unsure about the host and the port, use the values given by default.

Next, install all node dependencies required by the project by typing the following command in the project's root folder:

```
npm i
```

### Running the project

Make sure the `mongod` service is up and running, then start the server using:

```
npm run dev
```
